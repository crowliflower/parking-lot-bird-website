-- Pixelated font, soft orange tones. A bit minimalist, but plenty of identity and color. Use some more vintage design languages. styled like Old OSes 

-- make display layout for photos and styles     Still need to make it, but at least it is designed
  -defined by client's mockup. 
  -looks like multiple overlapped folders with buttons to scroll through pictures, as well as a bar at the bottom with thumbnails.
  -fancy pants z-indexing and clever use of pngs to get this look

-- define color scheme
  -Day theme --  soft fun oranges with cream background
  -Night theme -- Dark Greens, bits of burnt orange for accent maybe. Like a forest just before the break of dawn

-- Fully format page layout
  -Need to fix the placement of the website title (h1)
  -Get the pixelated font installed/pointed to using @font-face

-- make other pages
  -Don't yet know what these all will Look like, still need mockups etc.
  -Booking -- a contact form that the user fills out with their contact info, what they would like, and when they're free that automatically sends an email to the artist/website admin on form submission
  -Merch -- Not sure if this is to purchase or just view merchandise
  -About -- Basic 'about me' page, probably links to socials as well
  -FAQ -- Mostly for aftercare

-- design nav bar
  -The only task left is defining the 'current page' logic and styling so that the page currently being viewed is highlighted for the user so they know where they are
